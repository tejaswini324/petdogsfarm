<h3><i>Boarding Accommodation</i></h3>
<p>When you board your dog at Canine Country Club, you can choose from three luxurious accommodations:</p>

<h3><i>Luxury Cabanas</i></h3>
<p>These climate controlled suites are perfect for the ultra pampered pet! With a poolside view, your dog can sit and watch all of the action. Each cabana is themed and decorated which means Fido can relax in a lake, spa, golf, or tennis-themed room. Each dog will have a comfortable bed, color television, and private yard where they can play. And when it gets hot, there is a pool for them to cool down.</p>


<h3><i>Center Court and Front Nine Suites</i></h3>
<p>Our indoor/outdoor climate controlled runs feature cozy dog beds and private sound-dampened suites suitable for relaxing after a long day of fun. Your furry family member will love staying in this upscale suite.  Note: Indoor runs available upon request.</p>

<h3><i>Back Nine Suites</i></h3>
<p>Affordable Luxury for your furry friend. Back nine suites include raised bedding, climate controlled building and sunny outdoor runs. These suites are fun for all.</p>
