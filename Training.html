  <h4 style="color:blue"><i><u>Private Training (In-Home or at Canine Country Club)</u></i></h4>

  This one-on-one training program is tailored to your dog and their needs. We will train at your dog’s pace, working on both basic and advanced obedience, house manners, and all other commands you want to teach your four-legged family member. We offer a variety of courses that will fit into your schedule. Upon graduation, your dog is invited to take the S.T.A.R. Puppy and/or Canine Good Citizen test. In-Home Private Training is $140 per hour. Private Training at our facility is $95 per hour, or $47.50 per half hour. We also offer a Private Training Package at our facility- when you buy 5 lessons, you’ll receive the 6th lesson FREE.  Please call us for additional information or to schedule your next appointment!

  <h4 style="color:blue"><i><u>Behavior Modification</u></i></h4>

  If your dog has some bad manners or shows signs of aggression, behavior modification is what you need. This specialized course gives your dog the extra attention he needs when it comes to socializing with people or other dogs. We identify and tackle specific canine problems with the goal of helping your dog overcome these common issues.

  <h4 style="color:blue"><i><u>Family Lessons</u></i></h4>

  Your dog is not just a pet, he is a member of the family! That’s why it’s important to have your entire family be part of the training process. Family lessons gives everyone a chance to work with your dog and grasp the skills needed to make sure your dog is receiving consistency with each family member. Canine Country Club also helps prepare dogs, big or small, for the arrival of a new baby.

  <h4 style="color:blue"><i><u>Puppy Training</u></i></h4>

  Bringing a puppy into your home is a very exciting and happy time. It is also the most formative time for you and your dog. The most crucial imprinting period for your dog is between 6 weeks and 16 weeks old. It’s during this time when good and bad behaviors are established and you, as an owner, must set the rules that will follow your dog throughout their life. Canine Country Club will help you and your dog start on the right paw through positive and fun training games using basic techniques that will help eradicate bad manners. Whether you want one-on-one training for your new pup or group classes, we encourage you to start training early to foster a safe and happy lifestyle for you and your dog.

  <h4 style="color:blue"><i><u>Puppy and Dog Evaluations: Picking the best dog for you.</u></i></h4>

  Not sure what type of dog will best fit into your family’s life and schedules? Canine Country Club can help make sure you choose the right dog. We can guide you along as you select a desired breed or even choose to rescue a dog. Canine Country Club offers temperament evaluations on puppy litters and adult rescue dogs, which will help you make the right pick. Just like humans, dogs are unique with a variety of needs, so make sure your personalities are matched.

  <h4 style="color:blue"><i><u>Board and Train</u></i></h4>

  <p>Let your dog live and learn from us! Your dog is invited to stay at Canine Country Club up to four weeks. During that time we will work daily with your dog on basic training skills. At our facility, we will use both training and intermediate training, teaching your dog everything from sit-stays, down-stays, to place bed, heeling and name recognition. Afterward, we will show you how to continue the training to provide your dog with a seamless transition home and make his stay at Canine Country Club worth it. Board and Train Package price: $1199 for 3 weeks in a Back Nine suite (upgrade suites and Luxury Cabanas are available for an additional fee).</p>
